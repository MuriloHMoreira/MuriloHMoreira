### 🤝 Nice to meet you!
I'm Murilo Henrique Moreira, a **PhD student** in *Materials Science* at the **Federal University of São Carlos**. I'm currently researching numerical models and new experiments for efficiency gains in the drying of refractory castables at **Materials Microstructure Engineering Group (GEMM 💎)**. Furthermore, I also like **Python** and **HTML** a lot (still a long way to go, though). Right now, I am trying to build a [website](https://murilohmoreira.github.io/) to share some ideas, blogs, and interactive examples on a variety of subjects ranging from math to materials science. Perhaps one day it could be helpful to anyone right there!

If you are willing to take part in this, **join along and let's go!**

#### ⚙Projects
- *PhD Subject:* A teamwork led by Professor Pandolfelli and Co-supervised by Professor Stefano Dal Pont aiming to use and develop numerical models and neutron tomography experiments to study and enhance the efficiency of the drying of refractory.
- *[Intricacy of Complexity](https://murilohmoreira.github.io/ios/):* Used to be my ~~failing~~ personal blog, focused on math. I still want to work on it in the future! - 🏗 **Migrating to its own webpage** 🏗 
- *[Mechanical and Thermomechanical Properties of Ceramics MOOC](https://murilohmoreira.github.io/host_widgets/index.html):* Under the supervision of Professor Pandolfelli, the idea is to construct an online course (perhaps MOOC is not the best term, but we will roll with that) - 🚧 **In construction** 🚧 
- *Materials Reach:* The idea is to create a new media to complement disciplines on the Materials Engineering Bachelor course based in interactivity - 🚧 **In construction** 🚧 


#### 📄 Articles and Codes

#### ✨ Role Models in Web Activity (in chronological order):
- [Sylvain Deville](https://sylvaindeville.net/):  Researcher interested in freezing stuff. Very active and interesting takes on science at his [Twitter](https://twitter.com/devillesy)
- [Lorena Barba](https://lorenabarba.com/): Incredible notebooks on her [CFD Python](https://github.com/barbagroup/CFDPython), helped me to learn more about numerical methods and yield interesting ideas for the future.
- [Nicolas Rougier](https://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier): Awesome data visualization and interesting research. Awesome codes and very nice material for starters, you can find more him on his [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/rougier)
